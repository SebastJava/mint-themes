# Mint-Yz-theme's 12 branches: a short description

There are lots of branches here. You may think it looks like a mess. Well, there is a group of 6 branches in there. I should have named those 6 with some common prefix, just to make a clear presentation. And then there are those six others. Let's describe them all here.

Branch | Description
-------| -----------
auto | (OLD) Added and modified scripts for a complete automation. The `newcolors` branch was started from there. And then the `newflat` branch was started on top of all that.
cinthumb | Part of a GROUP of pull requests for the official Mint-Y. For a complete automation. One chunk at a time. Complete description: https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme/tree/newmain#readme 
colors-dir | Another pull request for the official Mint-Y. This one doesn't really change anything: it's just a separate directory containing new color suggestions.
ignore | (OLD) This is an old pull request to the official Mint-Y. Just a small `.gitignore` file. It still did not get approved as of 2021/07/17. Short story: each time i try some new colors, thousands of files are automatically re-generated. This makes comparisons and pull requests impossible for the official Mint-Y. This small `.gitignore` file would solve this problem.
master | This one remains untouched. So, if i want to create a pull request to the official Mint-Y, it must be for just one element, one bug fix or one new feature. So, i can start a new branch from this master one, and have only one new element on it, for one pull request.
menubar-toolbar | Part of a GROUP of pull requests for the official Mint-Y. For a complete automation. One chunk at a time. Complete description: https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme/tree/newmain#readme
newcolors | (OLD) That is a big one. It is a first series of subtle color variations. Everything is included in this branch: complete automation from the `auto` branch, plus all the new colors, and more. 
newflat | (NEW + DEFAULT BRANCH) That is the new big one. New colors for a new era. Colors to please everyone: mostly flat, subdued colors, plus some shining ones. Everything is included in this branch: complete automation from the `auto` branch, plus all the new colors, and more.
newmain | Part of a GROUP of pull requests for the official Mint-Y. For a complete automation. This newmain has merged all the other parts of this group for demonstration purposes. Complete description: https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme/tree/newmain#readme
