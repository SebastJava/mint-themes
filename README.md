# Mint-Yz: The New Colors of a New Era (Gtk theme)
**The interface of all your software and the entire desktop is now rejuvenated, modernized. This is a fork from your reliable Mint-Y theme. This standard Linux Mint Gtk theme now comes in more energized and readable colors.**

And all of this is done on a solid foundation of improved shell and python programs. It is also renamed **Mint-Yz** and is a separate Debian package. This means you can install it in addition to the standard **Mint-Y,** compare, experiment, and change your mind at any time. Your good old Mint-Y will not be removed or changed. And all of this is made very easy, see the installation instructions below.

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme/releases) page. Select the latest.
1. Click on **Assets** to see the files if needed. (under the short presentation)
1. Download the **mint-yz-theme_x.x-x_all.deb** file. (x.x-x = version number)
1. Open it and click the **[Install Package]** button.
1. Select your new themes in **Menu > Preferences > Themes**

### Carefully chosen colors and precise engineering
This color branch here is the sum of a lot of work. At the start there was the Horst3180 Arc-theme. On this well-designed and solid foundation was created the Mint-Y theme, which has evolved considerably since. Then I created a fork of this Mint-Y and made some improvements on the auto branch, to get the build process 100% automated. And finally, this colors branch was created on top of all that.

The colors convey energies, vibrations... They should not be too subdued. But they should not be set at full saturation and brightness either, because this could cause eye strain. So the saturation and lightness levels are carefully chosen here. And there is also the contrast with the white text in the foreground which received sustained attention. So these new colors here are not just nicer when compared with the old ones. They are nice, energized, driving, and more contrasted, thus more readable.

### Compare
Be aware that our eyes appreciate colors by comparison. When compared with the old ones, these new colors look much more saturated, vibrant. But then compare them with some fully saturated and bright colors and you will see these new Mint-Yz colors are somewhat subdued, but just not as much as the old ones. You can see this in [Mint-Y-Colors/compare](https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-themes/tree/colors/Mint-Y-Colors/compare) So i hope you will find these new colors are just well balanced.

Of course, not all colors are treated equally. There is no way you can make a seriously subdued orange without making it turn into some altered, brownish color. But if this orange looks too energized to your taste, just switch to another color! You have plenty of choice here. And if you are still unsure, you can always go back to the old colors. This new set is called **Mint-Yz** and gets installed alongside the old **Mint-Y,** letting you choose between the old and the new.
