# Automated color updates (wip)
This branch is only for adding automated color updates, making Mint-Y build now 100% automated. Before, these parts had to be done by hand and are now automated, just like the rest:
  * gtk-2.0/menubar-toolbar/
  * gtk-3.0/thumbnails/
  * cinnamon/thumbnails/
  * xfwm4/ (3 colored assets)

### Deleted files
In order to simplify and make things less confusing, these directories and files got deleted:
  * Mint-Y-Colors/ (The new colors are here on another branch.)
  * files/usr/share/themes/ (These were all the manual edits and thus are no longer needed.)
  * src/Mint-Y/variations/ (These are still needed, but they are automatically generated by `update-variations.py` on local HDD or SSD only. Testing different colors was generating thousands of modified files, and github/SebastJava/mint-themes/compare/ was made impossible. So these files will be ignored by `.gitignore`.)
  * colorize.py (This script got deleted because it only changed hues, not saturation and lightness. It was replaced by manual edits in files/ which in turn got replaced by this auto branch here.)

So now everything is 100% automated, the right way. I am not pretending to be a professional programmer. I just looked at the scripts already existing there in linuxmint/mint-themes, i saw how things were done, and i just carefully duplicated and tweaked some lines, basically. Well, i also added some little new lines of code and some images.

### Required
If you want to build your own theme, you will need to install those packages:  
  * Inkscape, preferably version 1.0 or higher  
  * optipng  
  * imagemagick

### Compatibility issues
There are a few `render-assets.sh` scripts scattered around the `src/Mint-Y` directory and its sub-directories. They contain some `--export-filename` or `--export-png` Inkscape commands. Check that you have the required command for your version of Inkscape, or just replace as required:  

  * Inkscape version 1.0 or higher: `--export-filename`  
  * Inkscape version 0.x: `--export-png`
