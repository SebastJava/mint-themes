# Mint-Yz: Your Linux Mint theme now in energized and readable colors
Your GTK theme is now re-edited in brand new, expertly designed colors. And all of this is done on a solid foundation of improved shell and python programs.

### I just want to see it and try it!
You can install this re-edited theme alongside the official Mint-Y. This new version is renamed **Mint-Yz,** so you donâ€™t have to remove the old one, and you can always go back. Just click (WORK-IN-PROGRESS)

### Carefully chosen colors and precise engineering
This color branch here is the sum of a lot of work. At the start there was the Horst3180 Arc-theme. On this well-designed and solid foundation was created the Mint-Y theme, which has evolved considerably since. Then I created a fork of this Mint-Y and made some small improvements on the auto branch. And finally, this colors branch was created on top of all that.




The colors convey energies, vibrations...
1. These hues have been chosen with care.
2. Saturation levels are somewhat reduced according to these rules: https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-avoid-bright-saturated-background-colors/ These saturation levels are adjusted depending on the color and brightness.
3. Sometimes, the brightness gets adjusted depending on the resulting color contrasts. These colors contrasts are measured with tools such as https://colorable.jxnblk.com/

Compare! Your eyes appreciates the colors based on the comparisons. Placed next to the old colors, these new colors may appear too bright, too vibrant. But when compared with 100% saturated colors, we see that these new colors are actually a bit subdued, so as not to be distracting.
