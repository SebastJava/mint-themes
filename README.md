# Mint-Yz: Your Linux Mint theme now comes in more energized and readable colors
Your GTK theme is now re-edited with some brand new, professionally designed colors. And all of this is done on a solid foundation of improved shell and python programs.

### I just want to see it and try it!
You can install this re-edited theme alongside your official Mint-Y. This new version is renamed **Mint-Yz,** so you donâ€™t have to remove the old Mint-Y, and you can always go back quickly and easily. To install and try this new one, click (WORK-IN-PROGRESS)

### Carefully chosen colors and precise engineering
This color branch here is the sum of a lot of work. At the start there was the Horst3180 Arc-theme. On this well-designed and solid foundation was created the Mint-Y theme, which has evolved considerably since. Then I created a fork of this Mint-Y and made some small improvements on the auto branch, to get things 100% automated. And finally, this colors branch was created on top of all that.

The colors convey energies, vibrations... They should not be too subdued. But they should not be set at full saturation and brightness either, because this could cause eye strain. So the saturation and lightness levels are carefully chosen here. And there is also the contrast with the white text in the foreground which received sustained attention. So these new colors here are not just nicer when compared with the old ones. They are nice, energized, driving, and more contrasted, thus more readable.

### Compare
Be aware that our eyes appreciate colors by comparison. When compared with the old ones, these new colors look much more saturated, vibrant. But then compare them with some fully saturated and bright colors and you will see these new Mint-Yz colors are somewhat subdued, but just not as much as the old ones. You can see this in https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-themes/tree/colors/Mint-Y-Colors/compare So i hope you will find these new colors are just well balanced.

Of course, not all colors are treated equally. There is no way you can make a seriously subdued orange without making it turn into some altered, brownish color. But if this orange looks too energized to your taste, just switch to another color! You have plenty of choice here. And if you are still unsure, you can always go back to the old colors. This new set is called **Mint-Yz** and gets installed alongside the old **Mint-Y,** letting you choose between the old and the new.
