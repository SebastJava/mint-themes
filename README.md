# Mint-Yz: The New Colors of a New Era (Gtk theme)
**The interface of all your software and the entire desktop is now rejuvenated, modernized. This is a fork from your reliable Mint-Y theme. It is the standard Linux Mint Gtk theme now in a new edition with more energized and readable colors.**

That’s 10 different colors in 3 different variants: light, darker and darkest. This makes 30 different themes, all included in one little Debian package. And all of this is done on a solid foundation of improved shell and Python programs. It is also renamed **Mint-Yz** and is a separate Debian package. This means you can install it in addition to the standard **Mint-Y,** compare, experiment, and change your mind at any time. Your good old Mint-Y will not be removed or changed. And all of this is made very easy, see the installation instructions below.

### Installation
First, check your system is not too old for this theme to work properly. This theme works well on Linux Mint 19, Linux Mint 20, and newer versions. (Gtk+ 3.22 or newer)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme/releases) page. Select the latest.
1. Click on **Assets** to see the files if needed. (under the short presentation)
1. Download the **mint-yz-theme_x.x-x_all.deb** file. (x.x-x = version number)
1. Open it and click the **[Install Package]** button.
1. Select your new themes in **Menu > Preferences > Themes**

### Carefully chosen colors and precise engineering
This color branch here is the sum of a lot of work. At the start there was the Horst3180 Arc-theme. On this well-designed and solid foundation was created the Mint-Y theme, which has evolved considerably since. Then I created a fork of this Mint-Y and made some improvements on the auto branch, to get the build process 100% automated. And finally, this colors branch was created on top of all that.

The colors convey energies, vibrations... They should not be too subdued. But they should not be set at full saturation and brightness either, because this could cause eye strain. So the saturation and lightness levels are carefully chosen here. And there is also the contrast with the white text in the foreground which received sustained attention. So these new colors here are not just nicer when compared with the old ones. They are nice, energized, driving, and more contrasted, thus more readable.

### Compare
Be aware that our eyes appreciate colors by comparison. When compared with the old ones, these new colors look much more saturated, vibrant. But then compare them with some fully saturated and bright colors and you will see these new Mint-Yz colors are somewhat subdued, but just not as much as the old ones. You can see this in [Mint-Y-Colors/compare](https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-themes/tree/colors/Mint-Y-Colors/compare) So i hope you will find these new colors are just well balanced.

Of course, not all colors are treated equally. There is no way you can make a seriously subdued orange without making it turn into some altered, brownish color. But if this orange looks too energized to your taste, just switch to another color! You have plenty of choice here. And if you are still unsure, you can always go back to the old colors. This new set is called **Mint-Yz** and gets installed alongside the old **Mint-Y,** letting you choose between the old and the new.

### Other design improvements
Version 2.0 and up comes with other design improvements. See the debian/changelog for a summary of all the changes. [See the graphic here.](https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme/blob/colors/Other-improvements-preview/Other-improvements-preview.png)

  * Buttons and entries rounded corners are a bit more rounded, 3px->5px. I never liked this 3px border-radius. This makes button’s rounded corners so subtle, it just looks like a rectangle with one missing pixel on each corner. Now this 3px->5px is not a radical change, you still get approximately the same flat design, but the corners on interactive elements are now just a bit more rounded. See the preview image above.
  * Focused button outline = selected_bg_color, to see what Enter key does. Example: When you close an unsaved document, you get a dialog asking whether you want to Close without Saving, or Cancel, or Save. One of those buttons is already focused, so you can just press Enter key to make that choice, or press Tab to move the focus to another button, and then press Enter. But before it was hard to routinely press the Enter key without having some doubts, because the focus was very subtly indicated with a thin dashed grey line. This line is now solid and colored, so you know what you are doing when you press that Enter key!
  * Messages colors are updated. There are various preset colors for various messages. There is the links colors, and that green color on that "Save" button, or that red color on the logout button, etc. They all got updated.  

### Express yourself
The official Mint-Y colors are currently being re-edited. Some people are saying the background colors should be subdued. That’s true, see this: [https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-avoid-bright-saturated-background-colors/](https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-avoid-bright-saturated-background-colors/). But take this with a pinch of salt: there is a difference between a page background and the background color of a focused element. You and i, we don’t want pale grays and beiges vaguely tinted with colors. WE WANT LIVING, VIBRANT COLORS! Well, okay, it should not be set at 100% saturation and brightness, but still... The official Mint-Y theme team seems to be going back towards the old Mint-X washed out colors. Or halfway between old and new, trying to please everyone... They claim that these old colors are more readable and easier on the eyes. I say these old colors are washed out, sad looking, and they clearly don’t have enough contrast with the white text to be easily readable. My Mint-Yz theme was created as a reaction to these old colors.
