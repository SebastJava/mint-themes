# Mint-Y color variations
### A new approach to please everyone

There are 16.7 million color possibilities. Itâ€™s way too much. We want to offer 11 or 12. With the dark and darker variants, that's 33 or 36.

This new approach is to offer a slightly smaller range of colors, focusing on the most popular, but with more variations. There are some dull colors taken from the old Mint-Y, there are several that come from https://flatuicolors.com/, and there are a few that are more vivid.

The https://flatuicolors.com/ offers a color palette created by a group of designers. These colors have been copied more than 25 million times from more than 150 countries around the world. The colors whose name ends with a "-2" have been slightly modified: it is a color located between the light version and the dark version of the same color on the same palette.

The few ColorShine colors come from the Mint-Yz-theme created by SebastJava. It's a fork of the Mint-Y theme that has been downloaded a few thousand times from https://www.pling.com/p/1408266/ without having advertised. And that is without counting the downloads made directly on GitHub. This Mint-Yz theme received many highly positive comments.
